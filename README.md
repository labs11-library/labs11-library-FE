### General

Bookmaps is a peer-to-peer library application that enables people to loan their collection of books, or rent books from nearby users. Easily search for books, add them to your library, and loan them out to nearby users. If a user is late in returning your book, you may charge a late fee.

Technologies used: HTML | CSS in JS | React/Redux | NodeJS | Express | SQL / PostGres | JWT | OAuth

### Technological/Feature Summary

- Implemented third party APIs such as Goodreads for users to search and add books to their libraries via title, author, or ISBN.
- Utilized OAuth so users can easily and securely signup or login via Google or Facebook.
- Users can search for books near them using our Google Maps API view, view user libraries near them, and check out books through the application.
- Lenders can charge late fees using our Stripe integration.
- Users can communicate directly through our integrated Twilio chat throughout the entire process without giving out sensitive personal information like email or phone numbers.
